```
Set Up a Scenario in Make
Log in to Make:

Go to Make and log in or sign up if you don’t have an account.
Create a New Scenario:

Click on Create a new scenario.
Depending on what you want to automate, you can start by searching for WeWeb or a generic module like HTTP, Webhooks, or any other relevant service.
Connect WeWeb to Make:

If WeWeb isn’t listed directly, you can use the HTTP or Webhook module:
Webhook Module: Set up a webhook in WeWeb to trigger an event in Make.
HTTP Module: Use the HTTP module in Make to send or receive data from WeWeb using its API.
Add Additional Modules:

Add other modules to your scenario as needed (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack, etc.).
Define Triggers and Actions:

Set up the triggers and actions you want to automate. For example, a form submission on WeWeb could trigger a new entry in a CRM system.
